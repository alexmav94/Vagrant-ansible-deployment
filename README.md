DevOps is the set of processes (including tools) you'll use to achieve one single goal; being able to release your project in a fast and reliable way. To reach this goal, they are all the usual considerations that come with DevOps, such as:

	- Automated tests
	- Continuous Integration
	- Continuous Delivery
	
Also meet the requirements and automate as much as possible to reduce delays between ideas, implementation and release to the audience. 
Accordingly to the above descriptiong with DevOps, Infromation Technology has been improving very well according to the past. Building a relationship between Developemt, Q&A and Operations is a new method that the team can deliver changes, various errors and many more tasks in a quicker and effectively, therefore client expectations are met upon requests. 
Infrastructure Automation however is the feature of DevOps where its a standard process in a scripting environment that installs OS, Applications, configuring server instances to configuring how the instances and software communicate with one another and much more. 
Taking action through the CI/CD pipeline (i.e. Jenkins and Bamboo) is the majority time used in DevOps, which is a procedure in Build, Test and Deploy. The majority coded applications and scripts run through this procedure before CI/CD tools approve its safe to present the products and/or services to its audience. 
SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) is key role in Development and Operations, this balances the time between Software Development and IT operations. Making sure sites run smoothly, efficiently, and more reliably. The role was developed in 2003 by Google, and with its success; large industries as Microsoft, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook use SRE to deliver positive outcome with their products and services to their consumers. 
As an Ops guy, I have learned at University to desing, implement and maintain computer networks with range of systems and tools. I additionally learned coding in C language, which I found very intresting. However the course did not offer additional subjects that involved programing, but only reviewing Yamal and CGI scripts for VM and Apache deployments on labs. But I enjoyed creating and planning implementations and configuring routers, switches and servers to create an IT enviroment. However after I graduated, I started putting my skills to the It Service Desk, delivering software and operating system solutions to potential incidents and deliver applications and/or hardware devices depending on requests. During my free time, I was developing my coding skills using Python. Also built a large intrest in DevOps agile having little labs using Vagrant, Ansible, Docker and AWS.
